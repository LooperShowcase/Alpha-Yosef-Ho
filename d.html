    <h1>maccabibneihaifa -Ashdod</h1>
    <p>
      27th fixture of the Israeli Premier League: Maccabi Haifa hosted FC Ashdod
      at Sammy Ofer Stadium. The playoffs opened with a storm and not only
      because of the rain. Four penalties, three goals, Atzili scored twice, and
      one red card for Batubinsika. Ashdod took the lead first with a successful
      penalty, following which Dillon was sent off (10’), Josh Cohen saved the
      second penalty from Kanaan's legs. On the other hand, Maccabi also was
      awarded two penalties, and Atzili scored them both (26’, 32’) to complete
      the comeback and secure the first win in the upper playoff. After the
      international break, Maccabi will host Hapoel Be’er Sheva.

        kick. 21’ Atzili provides a great cross from the right flank into the
        box, Gershon tries to shove it in with his back heel, but the ball goes
        just inches wide. 25’ GOAL! Pierrot receives the ball at the right edge
        of the box and tries to advance but the ball is cleared away from him
        when an Ashdod player punches the ball, a penalty kick for Maccabi!
        Atzili shoots it powerfully and scores! 1:1 32’ GOAL! Atzili shoots the
        ball powerfully from inside the box, but the ball hits the hand of one
        of Ashdod’s players and it’s another penalty for Maccabi! Once again
        Atzili takes the responsibility and shoots a powerful ball straight into
        the top corner. The comeback is completed, 2:1 for Maccabi. 34’ Saba
        storms forward through the center of the pitch and delivers a brilliant
        incisive pass towards Pierrot, the striker shoots from inside the box,

        66’ Atzili receives the ball after a successful tackle on the right

        above the crossbar. 74’ Double substitution for Maccabi: Raz Meir and
        Din David in, Omer Atzili and Dolev Haziza out. 76’ Dia Saba breaks
        forward and sends a great long ball towards Jaber who enters into the

        target. 84’ Substitution for Maccabi: Goni Naor in, Dia Saba out. 90’+7’
        Final whistle. Maccabi completes a comeback with only 10 players for
